				th: a(href='#whats-an-imageboard') What is an imageboard?
			tr
				td
					p
						| An imageboard is a type of discussion board where users share images and text about various topics.
					p
						| The primary difference between imageboards and traditional forums is that anybody can make a post without registering
						| an account or providing any personal information. This lowers the barrier to entry, protects user identities and focuses on what is said, rather than who says it.

				th: a(href='#name-formatting') Name formatting
			tr
				td.post-message
					p When posting, you can format the name field to include a name, tripcode , capcode, any combination of the three including leaving the field completely blank. Instead of a blank name,  "Anonymous" is used, however this depends on board-specific configuration. The optional components are explained below.

					b Format
					p
						| Names should be input like:
						input(disabled='true' spellcheck='false' type='text' value='Name##Tripcode## Capcode')
						| . Tripcode and capcode are optional components. Please note the whitespace before capcodes is significant.
					p Valid examples:
					ol.mv-0
						li name
						li #tripcode
						li ##tripcode
						li ## capcode
						li name#tripcode
						li name##tripcode
						li name## capcode
						li name#tripcode## capcode
						li name##tripcode## capcode
						li #tripcode## capcode
						li ##tripcode## capcode
						li ##
					p The last example is considered a blank capcode and can be used as a shortcut to display your role. Additionally, if a user has multiple aplicable roles (e.g. a board owner, but the user is also global staff) capcodes will default to their lowest role. To show the higher role, you must be explicit and precede any capcode with the role name e.g. ## Global Staff or ## Global Staff capcode
					p Each component can be used in combination or independently. In a post number 9 would look like:
						-
							const examplePost = {
								"date" : new Date("2019-08-02T09:48:44.180Z"),
								"name" : "name",
								"board" : "example",
								"tripcode" : "!!X8NXmAS44=",
								"capcode" : "##Board Owner capcode",
								"message" : "Hello, world!",
								"nomarkup" : "Hello, world!",
								"thread" : 1,
								"password" : null,
								"email" : "",
								"spoiler" : false,
								"banmessage" : null,
								"files" : [ ],
								"reports" : [ ],
								"globalreports" : [ ],
								"quotes" : [ ],
								"backlinks" : [ ],
								"postId" : 123
							}
						+post(examplePost)
					p The name appears bold in the top left, followed by the tripcode in regular weight with a !! prefix, then the capcode in a different color, bold and with a ## prefix. The colours may vary between themes but are generally distinct from each other

					b Name
					p The name is simply what name you want to be shown alongside your post. Other users can post with the same name so there is nothing preventing impersonation. This is not related to your username (for registered users).

					b Tripcode
					p A tripcode is a password of sorts, which users can provide in the tripcode component of their name. This tripcode is used in conjunction with a server-known secret to generate a unique* tripcode portion of the name. Long, unique tripcodes can be used as a form of identity. It is important that you keep tripcodes secret if you use them for some form of identity. A compromised tripcode can be used for impersonation and cannot be revoked in any way. Single # before tripcodes will use the traditional (what is now sometimes known as "insecure") tripcode algorithm shared by many imageboard softwares and websites. Double # before tripcodes will use a sha256 hash with server-side secret for a more secure, non-portable tripcode.

					b Capcode
					p A capcode is a component of the name field only available to authenticated users. This includes admins, global staff, board owners and board staff. If there is no text after the ##, the role will be displayed alone. Leaving a space and putting custom text will be prefixed by the role name. This way, the role is always shown to prevent role impersonation.

			tr
				th: a(href='#moderation') How does moderation work?
			tr
				td.post-message
					b Local vs. Global reports
					p
						| There exists the concept of "local" and "global" reports. Reporting a post locally will show the post along with reports on the report page for that particular board, and the reports
						| may be actioned upon by the board staff. Reporting a post globally will show the post along with reports on the global manage page available only to global staff and may be actioned upon by global staff.
						| Global reports should be used to flag posts that violate global rules such as illegal content or spam, in contrast to local reports which are for posts that abide by global rules but break
						| board-specific rules (which may be made arbitrarily by board staff). It is also possible to be banned from a board or globally for abuse of the report system.
					b Batch processing of posts
					p
						| Each post has a checkbox in the top left to select it for moderation actions. Multiple posts may be selected to allow batch processing e.g. reporting multiple offending posts in one request.
						| The same is present in moderation interfaces. Some actions for example bans (which are based on IP) may also be handled in batches. Selecting multiple posts and using the ban action will
						| apply a single ban for each unique IP of the selected posts.
					b Time format in moderation interfaces
					p
						| Some moderation interfaces, for example the ban duration when moderating posts, or the ban duration for post filtering use a shorthand for times/length. This format supports years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
						| An input of "3mo" would mean 3 months and "1y2mo3w4d5h6m7s" would mean 1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days, 5 hours, 6 minutes and 7 seconds. Units of time should be in descending order, so "2w1mo" is invalid.
						| However you may use "6w" for example to input 6 weeks, and are not required to use "1mo2w".

					p Force Action 2FA: If an account has 2FA enabled, the 2FA code must be input for: changing global settings, changing board settings, resigning from a staff position, deleting accounts, deleting your own account, or deleting a board.
