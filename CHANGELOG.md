### 1.0.0
Version 1.0.0 is here. jschan is stable and mature enough and has been for a while. There's no need to go to version 0.9999.9999 and I am comfortable enough to call it "Version 1".
Of course, that doesn't mean jschan is perfect or finished by any means. I want to keep improving jschan and there are plenty of new features and changes planned for versions 2, 3, and beyond.
Thank you so much to all the jschan site admins, users & contributors for your help along the way. Your contributions have been invaluable to making this software great.
Special shoutout to l29utp0 & loynet (ptchan.org), Homicide (94chan.org) and some_random_guy (trashchan.xyz).

-Tom

Now, back to the program. Here are the changes for 1.0.0:
  - **Multiple language support.**

jschan now supports language packs. There is a global and board-level language setting which completely translates the interface to another language. Using server side rendering and logic, so it remains noscript compatible.
An effort has been made to translate everything, but given there is almost 4 years of code, some things may have slipped through the cracks. If something isn't translated, please report it on gitgud.
    
1.0.0 includes three* complete language packs:
  - English (en-GB)
  - Portuguese (pt-PT)
  - Russian (ru-RU) *Machine translated, may not be accurate.

Huge credit to the ptchan.org admins for providing the Portuguese translation.
Contributions for new language packs or improvements to existing ones are very welcome! **Reach out via email, IRC, or session (See README.md) to discuss imbursement for contributing language packs.**
Note: "global" pages e.g. overboards will adhere to global language setting. In a future iteration, these will be updated to (optionally, with global setting) support adhering to users browser language header for better UX going between a non-global language board and global pages.

  - Notify the user when making a playlist from a thread if there were no files, rather than just silently logging.
  - Improves the css and markup to only show the appropriate wording e.g "tap" or "click" in tooltips depending if you are on mobile/desktop.
  - Improve the installation process to fix a potential issue with the database connection settings.
  - Customflags will now show correctly when editing a post on a board with custom flags enabled.
  - Security improvement to the 2FA validation flow during login.
  - Log a few more errors related to hcaptcha/recaptcha, for debugging purposes. (already caught and returned in a friendly manner)
  - Remove showing language and relevance data when auto detecting highlighted code block language.
  - Add more themes (cybhub, digi, favela, ptchan, teletext).
  - More minor bugfixes to permissions pages displays.
